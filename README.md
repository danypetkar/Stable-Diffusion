## Introduction
Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image generative model developed to create high-quality images from natural language prompts. By leveraging the latest advancements in deep learning, Stable Diffusion generates realistic and stylized images from text descriptions, making it useful for artists, content creators, and developers in various creative fields.

## Features
•	Text-to-image generation: Generate images from detailed textual descriptions.

•	High-quality outputs: Supports producing sharp, vivid images.

•	Customizable parameters: Adjust generation steps and guidance scales for greater control.

•	Easy integration: Run locally or in cloud environments, with options for CLI and Jupyter Notebook use.

## Model Architecture

Stable Diffusion operates by iteratively "denoising" a latent variable, guided by a text prompt. This process starts from random noise and progresses towards an image that matches the given text. The model uses a U-Net-based architecture, combined with a variational autoencoder (VAE), and is trained using latent diffusion.
